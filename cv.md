### About me

I can describe my strengths with one word - persistence.
This quality allows me to gain other skills for any goal and task. With enough efforts you adapt to any situation and become more efficient in anything. It's just inevitable.

I worked as a salesman for one and a half years. Also tried working as a marketer.  
Eventually, I decided to become a software engineer for a number of reasons:

- Ability to use English in real situations
- Creating really useful apps, even for personal use
- Remote work
- Huge supportive community
- It's a challenge. My previous job was outbound sales. One of the most stressful jobs for most people. Requires constant self-education. I got 50 to 100 rejections every day and had to convert them into sales. So, if I worked there, I can become a software engineer as well.
